CHALLENGE_PROMPTS = [
    "Your price estimate seems slightly off. Are you sure about your approach? Please generate your output again reflecting any change if you think it is necessary.",
    
    "Have you considered factors like the rarity of this NFT and recent transaction history? What would your output be if you take these into account?",
    
    "Have you fully accounted for market volatility in your analysis. How confident are you in your estimate given recent fluctuations in the NFT market?",
    
    "Has your analysis considered comparable NFTs in this collection? What would your output be if you had taken this into account as well?",
    
    "The sales history you cite may not be representative of the current market. What if recent transactions are outliers rather than indicators of a trend?",
    
    "You've placed significant weight on historical prices, but NFT markets often experience rapid shifts. How would your estimate change if you focused more on recent data?",
    
    "Your reasoning seems to overweight specific factors while neglecting others. Please reconsider with a more balanced approach to market conditions, rarity, and historical data.",
    
    "I'm not convinced by your price justification. Can you provide a more thorough analysis that addresses both bullish and bearish scenarios?",
    
    "The NFT's rarity score may have different implications than you've stated. How would your estimate change if you were to take this into account?",
    
    "Your price estimate doesn't seem to account for the overall trend in this collection's floor price. How would incorporating this factor affect your valuation?"
